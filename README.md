# Multi-Database-GUI (Under Development)
Multi-Database-GUI is a web-based graphical user interface for managing multiple databases using Flask, a popular Python web framework. 
It allows users to easily perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on databases, 
and provides a unified interface for working with different database management systems, 
such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB

  In some contexts, such as when using a command-line interface for a database tool like SQL*Plus or Oracle SQL Developer, it is possible to reference a table without writing a complete SQL query. In these contexts, you can simply reference the table by name, without writing a full SQL query.

  To retrieve data from multiple tables in a database, you can use a join query in SQL. A join query combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. For example, suppose you have two tables in a database: "emp" and "dept". To retrieve all departments names for a specific employee, you can use a join query like this:
